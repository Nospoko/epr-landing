### GitHub Pages

We use github pages to host the static page generated by next.js, see [workflow](/.github/workflows/pages.yml) for details.

We use https://namecheap.com to manage the domain, here are the dns settings:

It was a nightmare to setup both https://www.epr-labs.com and https://epr-labs.com, for details see:

**NOTE**: For www subdomain I had to set `algrtm.com` instead of `nospoko.github.io`, apparently because `nospoko.github.io` has `algrtm.com` set up a custom domain right now, and that's the route the project pages want to go trhough ðŸ¤”
